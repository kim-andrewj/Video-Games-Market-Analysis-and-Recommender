# Video Games Market Analysis and Recommender

## Project Overview
This project contains two parts: an Exploratory Data Analysis and a Recommender System. The EDA utilizes a dataset that was extracted from IGDB.com, a video game database acquired by Twitch, via the IGDB API to provide video game information from 30k+ known video games that contain user ratings amongst a realm of 200k+ total game titles. The notebook explores common trends for games that contain user ratings from IGDB and external critics. 

Here we try to answer the following questions to be tailored towards video game marketing and creation teams: 
1. In which genres does the highest engagement occur?
2. Which gaming platform sees the most success for each genre?
3. Do multi-player games play a factor in getting higher ratings and rating counts than single-player games regardless of platforms, genres, themes, age ratings, and player perspectives?
4. How do game ratings look for different platforms, genres, themes, age ratings and player perspectives and discuss why?
5. What marketing strategies are best for games of each genre?
